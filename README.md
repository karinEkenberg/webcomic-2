# Children's Storybook Project



A web-based interactive storybook created for my children, focusing on a seamless digital reading experience.



## Project Vision

The story, including all text and illustrations, is original work created specifically for a younger audience (ages 4–6). 



### Artistic Direction

The illustrations feature a deliberate "hand-drawn" and "sketchy" aesthetic. This style was chosen intentionally to resonate with children's own creativity and to provide a warm, approachable feeling that differs from polished commercial graphics.



## Features

- Original storytelling and character design.

- Minimalist web interface to keep focus on the narrative.

- Responsive design for reading on tablets and mobile devices.

- Focus on performance and accessibility.



## Technical Implementation

This project is built using a "Vanilla" web stack to ensure high performance and a low environmental footprint:

- HTML5

- CSS3

- JavaScript



The deployment is fully automated via GitHub Actions, ensuring that the latest version of the story is always available online.



## Security and Best Practices

As part of an ongoing focus on IT security, this project follows best practices for web development:

- Optimized asset loading (WebP format).

- Secure deployment pipeline.

- Clean, maintainable code structure without unnecessary third-party dependencies.
