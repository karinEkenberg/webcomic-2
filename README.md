# Sagan om Björn och Selma: Uppdrag Magivarelser

An interactive, web-based children's book designed with a focus on performance, accessibility, and environmental impact.

## Project Overview

This project is a digital picture book featuring the adventures of Björn, Selma, and Elvira. It is built as a lightweight single-page application (SPA) using a "mobile-first" approach and CSS Grid for a seamless reading experience across all devices.

## Performance & Sustainability

The project is built following **Green IT** principles to minimize carbon emissions and energy consumption.

* **Digital Carbon Rating: A+** – The codebase is extremely optimized, with HTML, CSS, and JS making up less than 1% of the total page weight.
* **Ecograder Score: 61/100** – High marks in UX Design and Accessibility, with future optimizations planned for image compression and green hosting.
* **Lighthouse Scores:**
* **Performance: 100/100**
* **Accessibility: 100/100**
* **Best Practices: 100/100**
* **SEO: 100/100**



## Technical Features

* **Responsive Layout:** CSS Grid handles side-by-side spreads on desktop and a vertical stack on mobile.
* **Custom Navigation:** Supports keyboard arrow keys and touch gestures.
* **Accessibility (A11y):** Full screen-reader support via semantic HTML and `sr-only` headers.
* **Performance:** Native CSS Scroll Snap for smooth transitions without heavy JavaScript libraries.

## Security & Best Practices

As part of an IT Security Engineering education, the following principles were applied:

* **Strict DOM Management:** Minimized script execution and secure event handling.
* **Privacy:** No tracking scripts or third-party cookies.
* **Clean Code:** Adheres to "Strict Mode" JavaScript and semantic CSS.

## Built With

* HTML5
* CSS3 (Grid, Flexbox, Animations)
* Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
